This PICOTRON cartridge was converted from a
PICO-8 cartridge, using p8x8 by pancelor.

=============================================


## CODE
The code has been extracted, but it 8will not work
out-of-the box! You must manually update it to
work with PICOTRON's API. (There are some tips
on things to look out for in the p8x8 release thread)


## MAP
PICOTRON has no mget or mset. I encourage you to
learn how to do things in the PICOTRON way -- you
can have many sprites and maps loaded at once,
with arbitary sizes!

But for a quick fix, here's a polyfill that should
make maps more familiar to PICO-8 people:

## SFX? MUSIC?
These are not (yet) converted.


enjoy!
