This PICOTRON cartridge was converted from a
PICO-8 cartridge, using p8x8 by pancelor.

=============================================


## CODE
The code has been extracted, but 8probably won't work
out-of-the box! You must manually update it to
work with PICOTRON's API. If p8x8 detected potential
issues, it created a warning file for you to examine

I encourage you to learn how to do things in the
PICOTRON way -- you can have many sprites and maps
loaded at once, with arbitary sizes!

But this cart is a good way to get something up and
running quickly. For more information, see

enjoy!
