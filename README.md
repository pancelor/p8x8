# Project moved
This project is now hosted on sourcehut:

This shouldn't affect you, unless you were contributing to the p8x8 codebase. Any updates will still be published on the lexaloffle BBS.

## Old links

# p8x8

(pronounced "p-eight-by-eight")

A tool to convert [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) cartridges into [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php) cartridges (some assembly required)

Created by [pancelor](https://pancelor.com/website2022-12)

Drag a p8 cart in, export a p64 cart, make some minor edits to the code, and voila! you can play PICO-8 games on your Picotron desktop!

![screenshot of 3 games being played at once. each was converted using this tool](https://github.com/pancelor/p8x8/assets/11308928/e3f6ae5e-24e3-4a98-a6c2-9aa8086ce299)

The goal here is not to perfectly emulate PICO-8 -- instead, the tool attempts to convert things well enough, and expects the user to make manual tweaks afterwards.
