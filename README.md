# p8x8

(pronounced "p-eight-by-eight")

A tool to convert [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) cartridges into [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php) cartridges (some assembly required)

Created by [pancelor](https://pancelor.com/website2022-12)

Drag a p8 cart in, export a p64 cart, make some minor edits to the code, and voila! you can play PICO-8 games on your Picotron desktop!

The goal here is not to perfectly emulate PICO-8 -- instead, the tool attempts to convert things well enough, and expects the user to make manual tweaks afterwards.

# USAGE GUIDE

## Quickstart

- Install p8x8 into your Picotron
	- `load #p8x8`
	- `save /desktop/p8x8`
- Put your PICO-8 cartridge into Picotron's filesystem
	- Type `folder` in the Picotron terminal to open the current folder using your host OS
- Inside Picotron, `load p8x8` and ctrl-r to run
- Drag mygame.p8 onto the p8x8 window
- Press the export button
	- A notepad will likely open up, showing the warnings that p8x8 generated. Manually change your p8 file, reimport and export. See [doc/compat.md](./doc/compat.md) for more info.
	- 
- Double-click the exported cart to run it!
	- `load mygame.p64` and check out `main.lua` for more info/options

Fullscreen mode: edit `main.lua` in your generated p64 cart -- there's an option to run the game fullscreen with a border image! But make sure that all of your cart's drawing functions are called from `_draw` (or some function called by `_draw`, recursively). If your cart runs any drawing functions during `_init` or `_update`, the fullscreen border will [look wrong](https://github.com/pancelor/p8x8/issues/9).

## Compatibility

Not everything will work. This tool is designed to give you a starting point, and requires manual changes after converting. Three major areas are unsupported:
1. **memory** (e.g. peek/poke/memcpy) is not emulated. The calls will still go through to Picotron's memory, but the effects will be different
2. **numbers** -- Picotron uses a 64-bit float numeric type, while PICO-8 uses 16.16 fixed-point numbers. Anything relying on the exact format of PICO-8 numbers (e.g. bitwise operators) will probably have problems.
3. **sfx/music** - this is not supported [yet](https://github.com/pancelor/p8x8/issues/5).

For more notes, see [compat.md](./doc/compat.md)

## Symbols

You will likely need to make changes related to PICO-8's special symbols. For instance, you will need to change `btnp(‚¨áÔ∏è)` to `btnp(p8x8_symbol"‚¨áÔ∏è")` or `btnp(3)`. For much more info, including custom fonts, see [doc/symbols.md](./doc/symbols.md)

## Photosensitivity warning

~~Carts that change the palette may rapidly flash the colors on the Picotron desktop.~~ This seems fixed as of Picotron 0.1.0e! But it seems worth noting still. Use at your own risk, and test your converted carts before distributing them.

# Details, more info

## How p8x8 works

PICO-8 carts expect various things to be in the global environment, things like `spr`, `mget`, etc. Some of these exist in Picotron's global environment, but many are slightly different, and some are missing altogether. (Picotron does many things differently from PICO-8, so there's no reason to expect everything would stay exactly the same)

The goal of this tool is to let you run carts written in "PICO-8 lua" inside of Picotron. This is achieved by sandboxing the PICO-8 code, and giving it a specially crafted global environment that has all of the standard functions it expects.

## Picotron API

This converter is a great if you want to get a cart working in Picotron quickly. If you plan to continue working on your cart, you should consider ignoring this tool, learning the [Picotron API](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php?page=faq), and porting your cart directly. (The code in the [polyfills folder](./baked/polyfill) might help you learn some of the differences)

However, if you need access to the Picotron API from inside your PICO-8 code, it's available under the `p64env` table. For example, `fetch` is nil inside your PICO-8 code, because that code is run in a sandboxed environment. Use `p64env.fetch` to access Picotron's `fetch` function.

I encourage you to read the [main.lua file](./baked/main.lua) of your generated cart -- it's the main file that Picotron runs, and you can see how it sets up the `p8env` sandbox environment. Also, there are some options in there that you can change -- fullscreen (with image border!) and `pause_when_unfocused`.

## Updating your cart when p8x8 updates

[TODO](https://github.com/pancelor/p8x8/issues/10)

## Help wanted
- open an [issue](https://github.com/pancelor/p8x8/issues) or leave a comment on the [BBS thread](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=p8x8#p) if you tried to use this tool and got confused -- then I can try to smooth off that corner and help others in the future be less confused
- add support for importing [sfx/music](https://github.com/pancelor/p8x8/issues/5)
- add basic support for [tline()](https://github.com/pancelor/p8x8/issues/8)
- more info in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## TODO
- [x] show lint errors easier
- [x] set better scope expectations. how much "emulation accuracy" are we aiming for (not much)
- [x] make CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] put list of chars that need replacing in docs somewhere, for easy searching: `[¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑‚Å∏·µá·∂ú·µâ·∂†‚ñÆ‚ñ†‚ñ°‚Åô‚Åò‚Äñ‚óÄ‚ñ∂„Äå„Äç¬•‚Ä¢„ÄÅ„ÄÇ„Çõ„Çú‚ñà‚ñíüê±‚¨áÔ∏è‚ñë‚úΩ‚óè‚ô•‚òâÏõÉ‚åÇ‚¨ÖÔ∏èüòê‚ô™üÖæÔ∏è‚óÜ‚Ä¶‚û°Ô∏è‚òÖ‚ßó‚¨ÜÔ∏èÀá‚àß‚ùé‚ñ§‚ñ•„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åà„Åä„Åã„Åç„Åè„Åë„Åì„Åï„Åó„Åô„Åõ„Åù„Åü„Å°„Å§„Å¶„Å®„Å™„Å´„Å¨„Å≠„ÅÆ„ÅØ„Å≤„Åµ„Å∏„Åª„Åæ„Åø„ÇÄ„ÇÅ„ÇÇ„ÇÑ„ÇÜ„Çà„Çâ„Çä„Çã„Çå„Çç„Çè„Çí„Çì„Å£„ÇÉ„ÇÖ„Çá„Ç¢„Ç§„Ç¶„Ç®„Ç™„Ç´„Ç≠„ÇØ„Ç±„Ç≥„Çµ„Ç∑„Çπ„Çª„ÇΩ„Çø„ÉÅ„ÉÑ„ÉÜ„Éà„Éä„Éã„Éå„Éç„Éé„Éè„Éí„Éï„Éò„Éõ„Éû„Éü„É†„É°„É¢„É§„É¶„É®„É©„É™„É´„É¨„É≠„ÉØ„É≤„É≥„ÉÉ„É£„É•„Éß‚óú‚óù]`
- [x] `#include` lint
- [x] `99do` lint
- [ ] better UI
- [x] basic mouse support
- [x] auto filename, but overrideable? backups are saved to `/ram/temp`
